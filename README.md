I use gawk to find all lines with 404 and 403 errors , then i print 7th substring , name of Urls .
Then i sorted by 7th substring , count and delete duplicates . I again sorted , because the list was out of order.
Then i use awk to print hyphens and percentage with uniq number. And print W lines , where W is input
